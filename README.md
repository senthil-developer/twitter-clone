- **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used in conjunction with Next.js to create dynamic and interactive components.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the frontend components. It offers a utility-first approach for building custom designs.
- **Radix UI**: Radix UI components are used for building accessible and composable UI components, such as dropdown menus.
- **React Query**: React Query is used for managing asynchronous data fetching and caching in the frontend.
- **Cloudinary**: Cloudinary is used for image storage and manipulation in the frontend.

## Backend Stack

### Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: Express.js is used to build the backend server. It's a minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database used for storing and managing data in the backend.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- **Mongoose**: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: JWT is used for user authentication and authorization in the backend.
- **Cloudinary**: Cloudinary is used for image storage and manipulation in the backend.
